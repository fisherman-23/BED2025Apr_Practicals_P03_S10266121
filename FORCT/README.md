What is MVC?

MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a design pattern used to organize code in software applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components: the Model, which manages data and business logic; the View, which handles the user interface; and the Controller, which acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

This separation of concerns makes applications easier to manage, test, and scale. By isolating the data layer from the presentation layer, MVC ensures that changes in one component do not directly affect the others, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
