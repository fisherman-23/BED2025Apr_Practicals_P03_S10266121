Look at the code in the final app.js file (where all logic is in routes and no validation). 
How easy or difficult is it to read and understand what's happening in each route handler compared to when 
the database logic was in separate functions?
It is challenging to read the codes as it is all in one place without abstraction. It makes it slightly harder
to understand what each route does, identify bugs or make changes. If it is separated into different functions
and modules, it would be better.


If you found a bug in how books are created in the database, which version of app.js would make it 
easiest to isolate and fix that bug?
The version of app.js where the database logic is separated into function and modules would be better, it improves clarity
and makes it easier to track down bugs.


Did you face any challenges while implementing this practical?
No.
